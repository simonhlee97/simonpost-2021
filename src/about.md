<p>About SimonPost.com</p>
<br>
I blog about tech and web development. But I am also going to blog about things I find interesting, so who knows what else will make an appearance here.

<p>About Me</p>
<br>
I'm a Korean-born 'Hoosier' (a person from Indiana), so born in rice fields, grew up in corn fields. I've also lived in Chicago and Seoul. I've been in Korea since Nov. 2018. I enjoy books, tennis, golf, podcasts, New Yorker Magazine, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Simon and Garfunkel, tacos, pizza, and burgers.
